## Technology Stack Explained

### Frontend Framework: React

**What it is**: Think of React like building blocks for websites. Instead of building everything from scratch, we use pre-made components that we can reuse and customize.

**Why we chose it**:

- **Reusable Components**: Write once, use everywhere (like having a template for cards)
- **Interactive Features**: Easy to make buttons, maps, and animations that respond to user clicks
- **Fast Performance**: Only updates parts of the page that change, not the whole page

### Styling: Tailwind CSS

**What it is**: A modern way to style websites using small, pre-defined classes instead of writing custom CSS.

**Example**: Instead of writing complex CSS code, we use simple classes like:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg">
  This creates a blue box with white text, padding, and rounded corners
</div>
```

**Benefits**:

- **Faster Development**: No need to write custom styles from scratch
- **Consistent Design**: All elements follow the same design system
- **Responsive**: Automatically works on all screen sizes

### State Management: React Hooks

**What it is**: A way to manage changing information on the website (like which kingdom is currently selected).

**How it works**:

- `useState`: Remembers information (like which tab is active)
- `useEffect`: Runs code when something changes (like loading a map)

## üìä Data Structure

### Kingdom Information

Each kingdom is stored as an object containing:

```javascript
{
  id: "unique-identifier",
  title: "Kingdom Name",
  description: "Brief overview",
  history: "Detailed historical background",
  games: ["Traditional", "Games", "List"],
  culturalPractices: ["Cultural", "Practices", "Array"],
  landmarks: ["Important", "Landmarks", "List"],
  mapEmbedUrl: "Google Maps embed URL",
  image: "Hero image path"
}
```

### Benefits of This Structure
